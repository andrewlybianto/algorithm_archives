Instructions:

Our project implements Depth First Search and Breadth First Search on graphs. The user may choose to either input a graph manually or have the computer create a random graph. To add nodes manually, the user specifies coordinates using two spin boxes and then clicks Add Node. This will cause a light blue node to appear at the specified location, along with an identification number. To delete a node manually, the user specifies an ID number using another spin box and then clicks Delete Node. To add and delete edges manually, the user specifies the nodes it connects and then clicks the corresponding button. Alternatively, if the user wants the computer to create a random graph, they can specify how many random nodes they would like using the appropriate spin box and then click on the Randomize Graph button.

To clear an entire graph, the user can click Exit and reopen the Simulate window.

To run DFS or BFS, the user can specify a start node by inputting an ID number into the Select Start Node spinbox and then click either DFS or BFS. The nodes belonging to the Minimum Spanning Tree output by DFS or BFS will turn pink!

After DFS or BFS, if the user wants to reuse a graph, they can click Reset Graph.

The user can also specify which colors they would like the nodes and edges to be in the About Window.
