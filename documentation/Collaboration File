Overall, the project was a team effort. Although we divided the work, most components of the project were worked on by multiple
group members.

Gilbert Neuner: Worked on design and painting of nodes and edges, implemented DFS and BFS, worked on presentation.
Design of nodes and edges includes (but is not limited to) using ID numbers to identify nodes, 
having graph know which ID numbers are available, having nodes know which other nodes are its neighbors, 
and using two nodes to identify edges.
